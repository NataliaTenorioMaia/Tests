#### About me

<img align="right" src="nat.jpg" width="45%"/>

<p align="justify">
I am a Doctor on Physics who is currently in transition from Academia to Industry. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh from 2017-2020 performing research on Gravitational Waves. I have been exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning in the past year. Currently, I am looking for jobs in Industry in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Physics.</p>
